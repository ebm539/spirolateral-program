# spirolateral-program
Spirolateral program for 13DS.

This program generates a list of numbers (that are digital roots) from a times table number, and then uses these numbers (along with an angle) to draw the numbers into a spirolateral.

This program requires [the otherSpiroClass.py file](https://github.com/ebm539/DSpirolateral/blob/master/otherSpiroClass.py) in the `lib` folder to run. If you're using git, run `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ebm539/spirolateral-program.git`

This program is for AS91906, and this repository is for AS91907
